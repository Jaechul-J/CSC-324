# World Population Analysis

To view the source code go into the Worldpop folder and click app.R, which contains both the UI and server source code along with the tidying process of my data.
If you would like to see what the app looks like on your end, you'll have to make adjustments to the read.csv command by configuring it to your own directory path.
Alternatively, you can enjoy my walkthrough of the application in the "Video Record.webm" by downloading it.

Hope you Enjoy!
